# Package Pages Improvements - October 12, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **White Text Visibility Issue - FIXED**
**Problem:** In the package overview section, containers with pin (üìç) and airplane (‚úàÔ∏è) emojis had white fonts that were not visible on light backgrounds.

**Solution:** 
- Added new CSS styling for `.overview-details .detail-item`
- Changed background to attractive blue gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #1a365d 0%, #2c5282 100%)`
- Made text white with proper shadow for readability
- Added golden left border (`#d4af37`) for visual appeal
- Added hover effects for better interactivity
- Applied responsive design (2-column grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile)

**Visual Result:**
- White text now clearly visible on dark blue background
- Professional, eye-catching design
- Consistent with site's color scheme
