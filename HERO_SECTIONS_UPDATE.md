```

## User Flow Improvements

### Before:
1. User lands on car hire page
2. Clicks "Book Now!" in hero → Goes to #cars anchor
3. Views car gallery
4. Scrolls down to find enquiry form

### After:
1. User lands on car hire page
2. Hero is more compact (faster to scroll past)
3. Clicks "Hire a Car" CTA → Goes directly to #car-hire-enquiry
4. Immediately sees the enquiry form
5. Can fill out and submit

**Result:** Reduced clicks and scrolling for users who want to book immediately.
